# Visual Analytics Project: Important People 
*Contributors:* Alper Calisir, Artur Back de Luca, and Stefano Cappai

### Dataset
We propose to use the [Pantheon 1.0](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/28201&version=1.0) dataset.
It includes 11,341 biographies that have support of more than 25 languages in Wikipedia.
These are further enriched with manually verified demographic information (place and date of birth, gender), occupations classifying each biography at three levels of aggregation and two measures of global popularity including the number of languages in which a biography is present in Wikipedia (L), and the Historical Popularity Index (HPI) a metric that combines information on L, time since birth, and page-views (2008-2013)

### General idea
Our general idea consists of creating a dashboard in which the end-user may explore the registered biographies geografically and temporally. We also provide the user some analyses regarding the popularity of someone's work with respect to its demographic information and occupation.


### Demo
The data visualization tool can be previewed [here](https://calisir.github.io/important-people/).
